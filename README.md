# TCP-transmission-software-based-on-PyQt5
This is a TCP transmission software based on PyQt5 design, and also my software course design.

## specific function
The concrete realization of the server and client mutual message, file download and upload. At the same time, both the client and server can be reconnected after being disconnected, the specific performance is that the server keeps listening; The client uses the timer to simulate the listening. Since there is no leased cloud server, it has been tested only on the local computer and the same LAN. In addition, there is no database set up in this project, so the download resource is temporarily set to the server side and a folder path is selected as the download source.
